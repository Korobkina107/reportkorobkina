Sometimes I walk mysterious places
Hear voices that talk without a word to say
Sometimes I hear the echoes of laughter
In the twilight of affairs and other tragedies

A half-moon away, way too close to heaven
She had the look, but no morality
Sometimes it's easy to forget only for a moment
But there are nights you regret eternally
